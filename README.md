# Travel Tracker

## What is this?
   This was a Mod 2 project for Turing's front end engineering program, exploring building an application from scratch, creating a full testing suite for the classes, and using fetches user data from an API, and posts to that API as well. It emulates a travel app that keeps track of a user's past, current, and future trips, and allows the user to select and submit a a new trip.

## How did it go?
   This project was a challenge. Many of the concepts of asynchronous JS were still fresh and had not been implemented before. A lot of time was spent tracking down and fixing bugs once the initial challenge of setting up the structure was achieved. Overall though, it was a success. All required functionality was achieved and a lot of learning was done.

## Where can we go now?
    - Implementation of a travel agent class and functionality for user of that type.
